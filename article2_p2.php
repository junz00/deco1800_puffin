				<h1>Chapter 2: If It's Flooded, Forget It!</h1>
				<article>
				<p>To stay safe while driving in flooded areas:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Check if flooding is likely and make alternative arrangements so you are not driving on flooded roads.</li>
							<li>Never drive on a road covered with waterâ€”floodwaters can be fast moving and hide dips, debris and roads that have been washed away entirely.</li>
							<li>Always follow the directions of flood road signs and road closures.</li>
							<li>Don't drive over previously roads until the road is open again. Sometimes the road damage is not known until
							the road is completely dry.</li>
						</ul>

				<p>Remember: Swift flowing water can sweep away your car and even six inches of water is deep enough
					to reach the bottom of most passenger cars, flooding the exhaust and leaving your car immobile. Never drive on flooded roads.</p>
