				<p>To stay safe while driving in flooded areas:</p>
						<ul>
							<li><mark title="You can see live updates of flooded roads on the Qld Gov Department of Transport and Main Roads' website">
								Check if flooding is likely and make alternative arrangements so you are not driving on flooded roads.</mark></li>
							<li>Never drive on a road covered with water â€” floodwaters can be fast moving and hide dips, debris and roads that have been washed away entirely.</li>
							<li><mark title="Sometimes the road damage is not known until the road is completely dry">Don't drive over previously flooded
								roads until the road is officially open again.</mark></li>
							<li>Always follow the directions of flood road signs and road closures.</li>
						</ul>
